Flagser is a persistent homology package for directed flag complexes.
The core library is a C++ program for computing the persistent homology of filtrations of directed flag complexes; a wide range of filtrations can be specified in a custom language.
The program can also be used on the web through WASM, and in Python through bindings provided by Giotto.
