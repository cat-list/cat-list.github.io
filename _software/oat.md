Open Applied Topology (OAT) is a software package for begginers through advanced
users in applied topology.
It specializes in efficient, user-friendly tools to 

- factor large matrices, and
- expose factored matrices to users in Python and Rust. 

This enables users to 

- obtain cycle representatives for persistent homology
- improve these cycles through optimization
- develop new and different algorithms for analyzing topological data, e.g.
  compute induced maps on homology

**Please note** This library is actively developed, so new features may not yet
be tagged on cat-list.
