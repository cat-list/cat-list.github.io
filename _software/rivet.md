RIVET is a tool for the visualization and analysis of two-parameter persistent homology. 
RIVET was initially designed with interactive visualization foremost in mind, and this continues to be a central focus. 
But RIVET also provides functionality for two-parameter persistence computation that should be useful for other purposes.
